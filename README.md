🚀 Completed Task-2 of my Power BI Internship with Cognifyz Technologies!
📌 Project Title: Gender-based Investment Analysis
📊 Tool Used: Microsoft Power BI
👨‍💻 By: Abhinandan Aggarwal

In this task, I worked on analyzing how investment patterns differ between males and females across multiple asset classes using interactive dashboards.

🔍 Objective:
To understand gender-specific investment behaviors based on:

Types of investments (Equity, Mutual Funds, Government Bonds)

Preferred frequency of investment (Monthly, Weekly, Daily)

Age-wise segmentation

Fixed deposit trends

📈 Dashboard Highlights:
✅ Visual Segmentation by Gender:
A donut chart clearly shows that 63% of the total investments were made by males, while 38% came from females — offering a quick gender split.

✅ Asset Class Comparison:
Bar charts display how each gender allocates their capital:

Males prefer Equity Markets and Government Bonds.

Females are stronger in Mutual Funds.

✅ Fixed Deposit Trends:
Line graphs illustrate how male and female participation in Fixed Deposits fluctuates with age.

✅ Age-wise Filtering:
Slicers allow for age-specific investment behavior analysis from age 21 to 35.

✅ Investment Frequency Distribution:
A separate visualization shows how often each gender tends to invest — monthly being the most common.

💡 Skills Applied:
Data Modeling and Relationship Building

DAX for custom calculations

Dashboard Design with KPIs, slicers, and dynamic filters

Insight derivation and storytelling through data

📚 Learnings from this Task:

How to turn raw data into actionable visual insights

The importance of user interactivity in dashboards

Gender-based segmentation in real-world finance data

Visual clarity, aesthetics, and design best practices in Power BI

🧠 This project enhanced my analytical thinking, sharpened my Power BI capabilities, and added hands-on experience to my internship journey with Cognifyz Technologies.
